# moodme

Index.html is supposed to be the code for the website. This is supposed to be an extremely simple website that says MoodMe at the top and takes in a user input (image). 


App.py is a python file where the index.html redirects the user to (Using Flask to communicate between the 2 languages), and this is where the neural networks are introduced and the emotion of the user is guessed.


Model.py is a python file that implements the use of tensorflow keras to train the neural network model we use to determine the emotions within app.py.
